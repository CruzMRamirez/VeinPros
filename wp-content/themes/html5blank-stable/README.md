Mail the form
---
To customize the way you send your form to your email. You must understand how the form works. 

<label> Your Name (required)
    [text* your-name] </label>

<label> Your Email (required)
    [email* your-email] </label>

<label> Subject
    [text your-subject] </label>

<label> Your Message
    [textarea your-message] </label>

[submit "Send"]

Once your form is finished it will look something like this.
the <label> is a Html tag this will display your input field. Your Name (required) is what your going to display before your input field is shown. 
[text* your-name] This bit is a bit complicated. The first part of [text* your-name] (text) is the type of input you are creating. The * means it is required before you can submit the form. The last part of [text* your-name] (your-name) is the variable where you store their information.

Now that you know how it works. you can edit where the information from the form goes.

Make sure you are on the Mail tab. Here you can edit the following To, From, Subject, Additional Headers, Message Body, and File Attachment. 
Whatever you enter in the "To" input field will detirmine where the information will go. Example: To: Joe@MySite.com will make it so that it sends to Joe@MySite.com. 
Here and onwards you can start customizing how the form will be displayed in an email. 
"From" will display who it was sent by. At default, the variable [your-name] is used to display what the user entered in the your-name input field.
"Subject" will display the subject of the email when viewed. At default, the variable [your-subject] is used to display what the user entered in the your-name input field.
"Subject" will display who it was sent by. At default, the variable [your-subject] is used to display what the user entered in the your-name input field.
"Message Body" will display the core message. At default, the variables [your-name], [your-subject], and [your-message] is used to display what the user entered in the your-name input field.
